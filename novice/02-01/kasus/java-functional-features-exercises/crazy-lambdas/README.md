Improve your lambda skills
### Task
`CrazyLambdas` class consists of static methods that return various functions, operations and predicates. 
Your job is to implement the *todo* section of that class using **Lambda expressions** and **method reference**. 
To verify your implementation, run `CrazyLambdasTest.java`
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with Java 8

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start implementing the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the **exercise/completed** branch and see the final implementation
