Improve your functional programming skills
### Task
`SumOfSquares` is a class that allows you to calculate a sum of squares in a provided range. It is implemented using 
 OO approach. Your job is to **refactor the todo section using functional approach.** So the **implementation will not use 
 mutable variables**, and all test will pass.
 
### Pre-conditions :heavy_exclamation_mark:
You're supposed to be familiar with Java 8

### How to start :question:
* Just clone the repository and start working on the **todo** section, verify your changes by running tests
* If you don't have enough knowledge about this domain, check out the [links below](#related-materials-information_source)
* Don't worry if you got stuck, checkout the branch **exercise/completed** and see the final implementation
